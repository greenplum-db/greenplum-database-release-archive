# Greenplum Server RPM Packaging Specification

Description of the expected behavior as it relates to RPM packaging for the Greenplum Server component

# Supported Features

1. All of the basic functionality offered by the RPM specifications

2. The package installation root is relocatable.

  Some users have IT and platform requirements regarding where software is installed. The default installation directory is `/usr/local/` but it can be changed during installation by using `rpm --prefix=[dir]`. Note: When using **rpm** for package installation, automatic dependency resolution does not occur.

3. Packages of different major versions can be installed at the same time.

  Data migration for a Major version upgrade require both major versions to be installed. Additionally, some users may wish to simultanously run multiple versions of Greenplum concurrently or otherwise with the ability to easily choose a different version of Greenplum. The package names are suffixed with a major version number, which prevents conflict and allows both `greenplum-db-5` and `greenplum-db-6` to be installed simultaneously.

4. Packages of different minor or patch version numbers can be installed at the same time using `rpm --install`

  Some users may wish to simultanously run multiple versions of Greenplum concurrently or otherwise with the ability to easily choose a different version of Greenplum. The package installation prefix is unique for every package, `%{prefix}/greenplum-db-[major version]-[version]`, and the package does not attempt to create a `/usr/local/greenplum-db` symlink. This choices prevent file conflicts between packages and allows a user to `rpm --install` to install many versions of the package. Note: When using **rpm** for package installation, automatic dependency resolution does not occur.

# Detailed Package Behavior

_Packaging Layer_
- The `Name` metadata field of the RPM package shall be `greenplum-db-[x]`, such that `[x]` is the Greenplum Major version number
- The filename of the resulting file shall be `greenplum-db-[x.y.z]-[PLATFORM]-x86_64.rpm`, such that `[x.y.z]` is the Greenplum Server version string and `[PLATFORM]` is one of `rhel6`, `rhel7`, `sles11`, `sles12`
- The package shall make any installed `greenplum-db` package, of the same Major version, obsolete upon installation. Examples:
  - If `greenplum-db` version `5.0.0` is installed, then a user installs `greenplum-db-6` version `6.0.0`, both packages shall remain installed
  - If `greenplum-db` version `6.0.0` is installed, then a user installs `greenplum-db-6` version `6.0.0`, only `greenplum-db-6` version `6.0.0` shall remain installed
  - If `greenplum-db` version `6.0.0` is installed, then a user installs `greenplum-db-6` version `6.0.1`, only `greenplum-db-6` version `6.0.1` shall remain installed
- The package shall by default be installed at `/usr/local/greenplum-db-[package version]` (Note: this is not the same as `/usr/local/[package-name]-[package-version]`)
- The package shall be named based on [Greenplum Filename Specifications](https://github.com/pivotal/gp-releng/blob/master/docs/Greenplum-Filename-Specifications.md)
- The package shall be [relocatable](http://ftp.rpm.org/api/4.4.2.2/relocatable.html)
- The package shall not create nor modify any `/usr/local/greenplum-db` symbolic link
- When performing an upgrade, downgrade, or uninstall of the RPM package, any changes to the installed `${installation prefix}/greenplum-db-[package-version]/greenplum_path.sh` file shall not be removed. (Note: This does not include transferring changes; It is only for saving changes)

_Greenplum Path Layer_
- `greenplum-path.sh` shall be installed to `${installation prefix}/greenplum-db-[package-version]/greenplum_path.sh`
- `${GPHOME}` shall by default be set to `%{installation prefix}/greenplum-db-[version]`
  - If the installation prefix for a package is changed from the default by a user, then `%{installation prefix` shall be updated during installation to reflect the user's preference
- `${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` shall be set to `${GPHOME}/lib:${PYTHONHOME}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH-}`
- `${PYTHONHOME}` shall be set to `${GPHOME}/ext/python`-
  - Note: the existing `test -x` shall be removed. Refer to [this slack conversation](https://pivotal.slack.com/archives/C4B0FBK0T/p1576523800033300)) for an explanation.
- `${PYTHONPATH}` shall be set to `${GPHOME}/lib/python`
- `${PATH}` shall be set to `${GPHOME}/bin:${PYTHONHOME}/bin:${PATH}`
- If the file `${GPHOME}/etc/openssl.cnf` exists then `${OPENSSL_CONF}` shall be set to `${GPHOME}/etc/openssl.cnf`
- [A portable bash shebang shall be set](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10376206/what-is-the-preferred-bash-shebang)
- The `greenplum_path.sh` file shall pass [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)

_Runtime Linking Layer_
- Any of the `elf` formatted files within the package at `${GPHOME}/bin`, that relied on `${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` being set for runtime linking, shall now rely on `${RUNPATH}` being set to `${ORIGIN}/../lib`
  - Exception: The following exceptions are golang binaries that shall not have `RUNPATH` set:
    - `bin/gpkafka` (Greenplum 6, Greenplum 5)
    - `bin/gpbackup_s3_plugin` (Greenplum 5)
    - `bin/gprestore` (Greenplum 5)
    - `bin/gpbackup` (Greenplum 5)
    - `bin/gpbackup_helper` (Greenplum 5)
- Any of the "elf" formatted files within the package at `${GPHOME}/ext/python/bin/`, that relied on `${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` being set for runtime linking, shall now rely on `RUNPATH` being set to `${ORIGIN}/../lib`
- Any of the "elf" formatted files within the package at `${GPHOME}/lib/`, that relied on `${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` being set for runtime linking, shall now rely on `RUNPATH` being set to `${ORIGIN}/../lib`
  - Exception (Greenplum 6): `${GPHOME}/lib/postgresql/quicklz_compressor.so` shall have its `RUNPATH` set to `${ORIGIN}/../../lib`
  - Exception (Greenplum 6, Greenplum 5): `${GPHOME}/lib/python/pygresql/_pg.so` shall have its `RUNPATH` set to `${ORIGIN}/../../../lib`
- (Greenplum 5): The `elf` formatted file `${GPHOME}/ext/python/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_hashlib.so`, that relied on `${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` being set for runtime linking, shall now rely on `RUNPATH` being set to `${ORIGIN}/../../../../../lib`
- (Greenplum 5): The `elf` formatted files contained within the vendored krb5 dependency, that relied on `${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` being set for runtime linking, shall now rely on `RUNPATH` being set to `${ORIGIN}/../lib`
- In all situations where `RUNPATH` is involved, if it is already set it shall be updated, if it is not set it shall be added
- When setting `${RUNPATH}` to the specified value, it **MUST** be done by setting the appropriate linker flags (e.g., `-Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/../lib`) with the following exceptions:
  - (Greenplum 5) The `elf` formatted files contained within the vendored krb5 dependency will have its `RUNPATH` modified with `patchelf`

# Usage

Documenation of how a user is expected to to interact with the Greenplum Server package. Each package state transition should end with a running cluster with a psql prompt (with the exception of uninstallation or currently unsupported state transitions).

### The state of the environment after an uninstallation

   The installation directory may still exist if any files contained within were not managed by the RPM package installer or if the `greenplum_path.sh` configuration contained modifications from what was initially installed
